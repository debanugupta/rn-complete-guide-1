Adding AppLoading
In the next lecture, we'll add the AppLoading component.

We will do this by importing it like this:

import { AppLoading } from 'expo';
This might fail for you - depending on the version of Expo you're using to follow along.

If it does fail, try this alternative way of adding it:

expo install expo-app-loading
import AppLoading from 'expo-app-loading';
